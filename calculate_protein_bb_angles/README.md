# Calculate Phi, Psi, and Omega Angles from PDB

This Python script computes backbone torsion angles **φ (phi)**, **ψ (psi)**, and **ω (omega)** for residues in a protein structure from a PDB file, and outputs them to a CSV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- [Biopython](https://biopython.org/)

## Usage
```bash
python3 calculate_phi_psi_omega.py your_structure.pdb output.csv
your_structure.pdb --> input PDB file
output.csv --> path to save the torsion angle data in degrees
```
